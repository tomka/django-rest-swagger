YAML Docstring
====================
Docstring parser powered by YAML syntax

This parser allows you override some parts of automatic method inspection
behaviours.

Example: 
    
.. code-block:: python

    @api_view(["POST"])
    def foo_view(request):
        """
        Your docs
        ---
        # YAML (must be separated by `---`)

parameters
--------------------------
Define parameters and their properties in docstrings:

.. code-block:: yaml

    parameters:
        - name: some_param
          description: Foobar long description goes here
          required: true
          type: integer
          paramType: form
        - name: other_foo
          paramType: query
        - name: avatar
          type: file

For the fields allowed in each parameter, see the 
`Parameter Object <https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md#524-parameter-object>`_ 
fields and the 
`Data Type Fields <https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md#433-data-type-fields>`_.

Exceptions: `$ref` is not currently supported.

parameters meta-fields
----------------------
pytype
~~~~~~

If you have a Django Rest Framework serializer that you would like to use 
to populate :code:`type` you can specify it with :code:`pytype`:

.. code-block:: yaml

    pytype: .serializers.FooSerializer

Overriding parameters
---------------------

parameters_strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is possible to override parameters discovered by method inspector by
defining:
`parameters_strategy` option to either `merge` or `replace`

To define different strategies for different `paramType`'s use the
following syntax:

.. code-block:: yaml

    parameters_strategy:
        form: replace
        query: merge

By default strategy is set to `merge`

omit_parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes the method inspector produces a list of parameters that
you might not want to see in SWAGGER form. To handle this situation
define `paramTypes` that should be omitted

.. code-block:: yaml

    omit_parameters:
        - form

Serializers
-------------------------

You can explicitly specify the serializer:

.. code-block:: yaml

    serializer: some.package.FooSerializer

`serializer` can take a relative path, or no path. Lookup begins in the 
module of the view:

.. code-block:: yaml

    serializer: .package.FooSerializer
    
    serializer: FooSerializer

You can specify different serializers for request and response:

.. code-block:: yaml

    request_serializer: some.package.FooSerializer
    response_serializer: some.package.BarSerializer

You can prevent django-rest-swagger from using any serializer:

.. code-block:: yaml

    omit_serializer: true


type
-----------------------
If your view does not use a serializer at all but instead outputs a simple
data type such as JSON you may define a custom response object in the method
signature as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    type:
      name:
        required: true
        type: string
      url:
        required: false
        type: url

.. _many:

many
----

In cases where an API response is a list of objects, it is possible to mark
this to django-rest-swagger by overriding :code:`many` to `True`.

.. code-block:: yaml

    many: true

This overrides the :code:`type` returned to be an array of the resolved API
type. ViewSet :code:`list` methods do not require this definition, and are
marked as :code:`many` automatically.

models
------------------------
If you define a custom response object in :code:`type`, you may also need
to define other models for the response to use:

.. code-block:: yaml

    models:
      custom_model_id:
      id: custom_model_id
      properties:
        name:
          required: true
          type: string
        url:
          required: false
          type: url

You must ensure the the identifiers of these custom models are unique for
each resource, including that they do not conflict with any identifiers
automatically generated by :code:`type`.

responseMessages 
---------------------------------
To document error codes that your APIView might throw
you can define them in :code:`responseMessages`:

.. code-block:: yaml

    responseMessages:
        - code: 401
          message: Not authenticated
        - code: 403
          message: Insufficient rights to call this procedure


Media Types
---------------------------------
To document supported media types as input or output you can
define them as :code:`consumes` and/or :code:`produces`, respectively

.. code-block:: yaml

    consumes:
        - application/json
        - application/xml
    produces:
        - application/json
        - application/xml

Different models for reading and writing operations
---------------------------------------------------
REST Framework does not output write_only fields in responses and also
does not require read_only fields to be provided. It is worth to
automatically register 2 separate models for reading and writing operations.

The discovered serializer will be registered with `Write` or `Read` prefix.
Response Class will be automatically adjusted if serializer class was
detected by method inspector.

You can also refer to these models in your parameters:

.. code-block:: yaml

    parameters:
        - name: CigarSerializer
          type: WriteCigarSerializer
          paramType: body


view_mocker
-----------
Specify a function to modify (or replace entirely) the view that 
django-rest-swagger uses to introspect serializer class.

django-rest-swagger passes this function a view object, and expects a view 
object to be returned, or None, in which case this bit of introspection is 
skipped.

.. literalinclude:: ../../rest_framework_swagger/tests.py
    :pyobject: ViewMockerNeedingAPI

.. literalinclude:: ../../rest_framework_swagger/tests.py
    :pyobject: my_view_mocker
